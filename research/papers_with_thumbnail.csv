This pattern transformation can be exploited to design structures for various potential applications. Previous studies have focused on the instability of periodic porous structures of which the base materials were elastomers, and applications of these structures may be narrow because of the elastomer limitations of low melting temperature and stiffness. In addition, material failures such as plasticity and fracture were rarely discussed in previous studies. Here, we introduce metals as the base materials for some periodic metallic porous nanostructures (PMPNs). Our molecular dynamics simulation results show that PMPNs can exhibit pattern transformation at a critical strain because of buckling. In addition, we develop a simple formulation by incorporating the effect of surface on the Euler–Bernoulli beam theory to predict the critical load for the buckling of nanostructures. The prediction of our model is in good agreement with the molecular dynamics simulation results. When the applied strain is sufficiently large, the nanoscale metals experience dislocation-medicated plasticity. We also show that the pore shape of the PMPNs strongly affects the characteristics of the periodic metallic structures including the effective Young’s modulus, critical strain for micro-buckling, and critical strain for plasticity.",2/1/2019,10/25/2018 4:34,1/7/2021 12:16,12/1/2020 12:02,17-24,,,157,,Computational Materials Science,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,ZSCC: 0000005,,C:\DATA\Softs\Cite_Management\Zotero\Zotero_Data_Directory\storage\6M9T8AHZ\Nguyen et al_2019_Pattern transformation induced by elastic instability of metallic porous.pdf; C:\DATA\Softs\Cite_Management\Zotero\Zotero_Data_Directory\storage\ZK2CL4K3\S0927025618306955.html,,Buckling; Metals; Molecular dynamics simulation; Porous structure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, numerical and theoretical evidences have been provided to show that two different elastic instabilities are, rather than deleterious, useful phenomena that cause auxeticity. It has been shown that a negative Poisson's ratio can be found in some face-centered cubic (FCC) single crystals at a finite strain as they are under uniaxial stress along the [100]-direction. The auxeticity is associated with a phase transformation induced by the Born–Hill's elastic instability, i.e., an elastic material instability. In addition, it has been found that periodic metallic porous structures can also show a negative Poisson's ratio at finite compressive strain. In this case, buckling of the micro-structure of the porous structures, which is an elastic and geometric instability, is respondent for the auxeticity.",2019,1/17/2019 5:38,6/7/2021 10:05,7/7/2020 5:00,1800122,,1,256,,,,,,,,,,en,"© 2018 WILEY‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The density and distribution of hydrogenation may significantly affect the Poisson’s ratio of the graphene structure. Therefore, optimization of the distribution of hydrogenation is useful to achieve the structure with a targeted Poisson’s ratio. For this purpose, we developed an inverse design algorithm based on machine learning using the XGBoost method to reveal the relationship between the Poisson’s ratio and distribution of hydrogenation. Based on this relationship, we can optimize the hydrogenated graphene structure to have a low Poisson’s ratio. Instead of performing molecular dynamic simulations for all possible structures, we could find the optimal structures using the search algorithm and save significant computational resources. This algorithm could successfully discover structures with low Poisson’s ratios around −0.5 after only 1600 simulations in a large design space of approximately 5.2 × 106 possible configurations. Moreover, the optimal structures were found to exhibit excellent flexibility under compression of around −65% without failure and can be used in many applications such as flexible strain sensors.

The free energy of both solid and liquid depends linearly on the system size by the leading term (1/N). However, system size has the opposite effect on the free energy of the solid and liquid phases. The size-dependence of free energy is less noticeable for liquid than solid but is enhanced upon heating. It turns out that the estimated thermodynamic melting is affected by the system size, which is more significant at a small size.

Our simulation results demonstrate a dominance of the coalescence mechanism on the Al(110) surface resulting in the ﬂat melting front, whereas the shape of melting front on the Al(111) surface is spherical-like due to the weakness of coalescence mechanism.

Besides several advantages over the currently available methods, our result shows that the value of thermodynamic melting predicted by this approach has a very minor dependence on system size while giving a comparable accuracy. Meanwhile, the predicted mechanical melting is in good agreement with the Born criterion of elastic stability.
